    <div class="pubs-text pubs-block">
        Feature matching is a fundamental step in many
real-time computer vision applications such as Simultaneous
Localization And Mapping (SLAM), motion analysis and stereo
correspondence. The performance of these applications depends
on the distinctiveness of the visual feature descriptors used,
and the speed at which they can be extracted from video
frames. When combined with standard key-point detectors, the
rotation-aware Binary Robust Independent Elementary Features
(rBRIEF) descriptor has been shown to outperform its counterparts. In this paper, 
we present a deep-pipelined stream processing architecture that is capable of extracting rBRIEF features
from high-throughput video frames. To achieve high processing
rate and low complexity hardware, the proposed architecture
incorporates an enhanced moving summation strategy to calculate the key-points’ patch moments and employs approximate
computations to achieve patch rotation. Multiplier-less circuitry
is introduced throughout the architecture to avoid the use of
costly multipliers. Implementation on the Altera Aria V device
demonstrates that the proposed architecture leads to 53.3%
reduction in hardware resources (adaptive logic modules) while
achieving 50% higher accuracy (in terms of average Hamming
distance) when compared to the state-of-the-art architecture.
In addition, the proposed architecture is able to process highresolution (1920×1080) images at 60 fps while consuming only
456.15 mW power.

        Our work presents a low complexity stream processing architecture that is capable of extracting rBRIEF features
        from high-throughput video frames. The main contributions of this paper:

            <li>
                A novel deep-pipelined architecture that can extract
                rBRIEF feature descriptors on-the-fly from high-rate input pixel streams without utilizing any image frame
                buffers.
            </li>
            <li>
                An enhanced moving summation strategy is proposed to
                calculate the key-point’s patch moments, which significantly reduces the hardware complexity. The proposed
                architecture does not use any conventional multipliers to
                perform rBRIEF feature computation. Instead multiplierless circuitries leveraging on single constant multiplication are introduced throughout the architecture to avoid
                the use of costly multipliers.
            </li>
            <li>
                Approximate computation based on novel angle discretization methods is applied to compute the orientation
                of the patch. In addition, a folded architecture is proposed
                to rotate the BRIEF point-pairs by exploiting the sparsity
                of key-points.
            </li>
            <li>
                A comprehensive evaluation on the effect of approximation and bit-width truncation is undertaken to obtain the
                optimal trade-off between accuracy and complexity of the
                proposed architecture

        extractor is designed with a low-complexity deep-pipelined
        architecture. The proposed hardware-efficient strategies enable
        additional pipeline stages to be introduced in the computation
        units (i.e. 5 stages for Centroid unit, 5 stages in Angle unit,

    <div class="pubs-section pubs-block">Accuracy Evaluation</div>
    <p class="pubs-block pubs-text">In the Angle unit, an approximation is applied to calculate
        the centroid angle of a patch centered at a key-point. The
        centroid angle is discretized into NT possible values and
        the multiplication of discretized angle values are represented
        with BT bits. We have used Displacement and Hamming
        distance to evaluate the effects of our approximation methods
        for the proposed rBRIEF feature extractor. Displacement in
        rotated coordinates between the actual calculation and the
        approximate calculation is employed to quantitatively evaluate
        the accuracy of the approximation. Hamming distance, which is a metric that is often used in
        feature matching, is employed to validate the effect of the
        approximation method on the final output descriptors. The Displacement is defined as follows:

        $$
            \begin{align}
            \tag{4}
            \text{Displacement} = \sqrt{(rx - rx_{ac})^2 + (ry - ry_{ac})^2}

        Figure 2 shows the accuracy evaluation of angle discretization
        with respect to \(N_T\) (number of discretized values of angle) in terms of (a) Displacement and (b) Hamming distance.
        \(B_T\sharp n \) denotes n bits that are used to
        represent the discretized angle values. It can be observed that
        Displacement is significantly reduced when \(N_T\)  increases to
        25. Hamming distance has the same trend but presents small variation.

    <p class="pubs-block pubs-text">
        The optimal number of bits \(B_C\) for representing centroid
        moments is also investigated. Figure 3 shows (a) the Displacement and (b) the average Hamming distance of approximate
        calculation with respect to varying number of bits used for
        representing the absolute value of centroid moments (i.e.
        m01, m10). The displacement is also reported with different
        angle discretization options. \(N_T\sharp n \) denotes that the angle is
        discretized with \(N_T = \sharp n \) values. It can be observed that
        the average displacement sharply increases when BC reduces
        below 9.

        In addition, the optimal bit-width of \(\cos \theta \), \(\sin \theta \) values (i.e.
        \(B_{CS}\)) is investigated to further reduce the hardware complexity
        of the the Rotator unit. This study is based on the optimal
        discretization of the centroid angle \(N_{T}\) = 25 which we have
        determined earlier. Figure 4 illustrates the average coordinate
        displacement with varying \(B_{CS} \) with respect to each \(N_{T}\) .The
        displacement for each \(N_{T}\) rapidly decreases as BCS increase
        to 7. The displacement of all the 25 cases is below 0.25
        if \(B_{CS}\) = 7 bits is employed to represent the cosθ, sinθ
        values. Further increase in \(B_{CS}\) does not lead to any notable
        displacement reduction. Therefore, \(B_{CS}\) = 7 is selected for
        the proposed architecture.

        Table I summarizes the design parameters and compares the hardware utilization of the proposed implementation (denoted
        as Proposed) with the implementation in [1] (denoted as Existing). To obtain a fair comparison, both implementations
        targets the Arria V GX 5AGXFB3 device and employ the
        same number of descriptor generator components \(N_{D}\). It can be observed that the proposed implementation
        consumes significantly reduced number of Logic Elements
        (LEs) and Adaptive Logic Modules (ALMs) compared to the existing implementation. The LE and ALM utilization
        of Proposed is only 63.5% and 46.7%, respectively, of the
        existing architecture. The memory bits usage of Proposed is
        larger than that of Existing. However, the memory bits required
        in both implementations consume only a fraction (i.e. about
        0.6%) of the total FPGA space. Interestingly, the proposed implementation avoids the use of power-hungry DSP blocks due
        to utilization of the constant multiplier blocks. In contrast, the
        existing implementation employs 92 DSP blocks. Furthermore,
        the hardware efficient strategies adopted by Proposed have
        resulted in a higher maximum clock frequency. In particular,
        Proposed achieves a higher operating frequency of 177 MHz
        compared to the clock frequency of 150 MHz for Existing on
        the same target FPGA platform
